## About:
This tool was created due to the author's need for format conversion functionality and concerns about potential `information leakage` from uploading related files to `online platforms`.

Unlike local conversion tools, you can deploy it on a remote server, where the conversion process will take place on the remote host, providing more options for conversion on mobile devices.

2. The author's skill level is not high; this is purely a beginner's project developed with the help of Google programming and borrowing code from many experts. Please modify it as you see fit.

## Supported Platforms:
Server: Windows && Linux

Frontend: Desktop Web, Mobile Web (partially adapted)

## TODO

> [!TIP]
>
> - [ ‚àö ] File Size Limit - Configurable file upload size limit in config.json
> - [ ‚àö ] Automatic Deployment - Now you only need to download the static pages and the program itself to run immediately
> - [ ‚àö ] Password Protection - Now supports setting a password in config.json to protect your application

## Deployment

You need to download the `static` folder and the corresponding `FormatConver` executable for your operating system, then place them together.

It is recommended to run FormatConver using CMD in Windows rather than directly opening it.
```
# Windows
FormatConver

# Linux
chmod +x FormatConver
./FormatConver
```
fter running, the program will automatically create and download the necessary files.

On the first startup, please manually configure `config/config.json`.

## Config.json

The following explains the contents of the configuration file. This is for reference only and does not mean you can copy and paste them directly.
```
{
  "ServerConfig": {
    "Port": 8081, # WebAPI port
    "UploadPath": "upload/", # Path for user-uploaded files
    "OutPutPath": "output/", # Path for exported files
    "UploadFileSize": 100, # Maximum allowed file upload size (set according to your host's performance)
    "Qscale": 1, # Default quantization parameter (smaller values mean higher image quality)
    "EnableQscaleControl": true, # Whether to allow users to control the quantization parameter
	  "CoverGruopProcessNum": 2 # Number of concurrent conversion processes allowed (set according to your host's performance)
  },
  "SecConfig": {
    "PassWord": "" # Access password (leave empty for no password verification)
  },
  "ConverConfig": {
    "VideoFormats": [ # Allowed conversion formats below
      "MP4",
      ...
    ],
    "AudioFormats": [
      "MP3",
      ...
    ],
    "ImageFormats": [

      ...
    ]
  }
}
```
